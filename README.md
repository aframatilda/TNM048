A course in information visualization

A course I read my 4th year in MS in Media Technology and Engineering. The course provided the theoretical framework necessary to work with information visualization. 
You learned to deal with methods for interactive visualization of large complex amounts of data, common in areas such as the environment, 
health process control, bioinformatics, etc. 

The project me and my student colleagues made is called "Find Your Wine", which is a recommender/guide to find a wine based on a users preferences. 
The data is fetched from SystembolagetÂ´s API. The project is made in Javascript, HTML and CSS.
